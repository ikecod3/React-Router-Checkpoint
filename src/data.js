      "Ethan Hunt and his IMF team must track down a dangerous weapon before it falls into the wrong hands. A next-generation Russian submarine Sevastopol employs an advanced AI, activated by a two-pieced cruciform key. The AI deceives the crew into attacking a phantom target only to be struck by their own torpedo, killing all aboard. IMF agent Ethan Hunt travels to the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to retrieve one-half of the key from disavowed MI6 agent Ilsa Faust, who carries a bounty from an unknown source. Ethan retrieves the half-key and fakes Ilsa's death. Back in Washington, D.C., Ethan infiltrates a U.S. Intelligence Community briefing for Director of National Intelligence Denlinger to discuss the rogue AI. Director Eugene Kittridge recounts how the 'Entity' has achieved sentience and can manipulate major defense intelligence and financial networks of the world at will. World powers compete to obtain the key to control the Entity, though the exact means of controlling it are unknown.",
